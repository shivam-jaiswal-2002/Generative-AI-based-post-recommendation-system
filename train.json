You can withdraw principal cash (not the growth) penalty and tax free if you ever get super screwed by an emergency. You can also choose to invest in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and a lot more as opposed to a 401k.  Pay into the 401(ks) up to the match - both you and your wife - then both of you max out Roth IRAs in each of your names ($6k each).  After that, contribute left over money to 401(k) and keep working your way up the 401k savings rates until you both max out.  \n\nAlso, you may want to think about diversifying your tax liability.  That's a strategy that's always overlooked.  Think about a traditional 401k and a Roth IRA to help diversify your tax liabilities in the future.  "

(so 80k into VTSAX/20k VGTSX for example)\n\njust doing that will set you ahead of vast majority.  put 10k-15k in, 12k/3k in the two funds for example. then each month you can set automatic additions, and steadily add 1-2k a month between the two funds.\n\n\n\ndisclosure:the funds i mentioned have 10k minimums, you could do VTI/VXUS which are exactly the same funds from vanguard that don't have a minimum but you can't set up automatic contributions, you will manually have to login in each time to add more money."

(which after your first one should take less than two years to stack up another 18k)\n\nnow you have 6k in passive income coming in. yes you have a mortgage but eventually it will be paid off. you think in 30 years you won't get 8-10k of rent from 8 apartments? now you have 95-120k income every year (minus property taxes/insurance so maybe minus 9k for that).\n\nthis is not including any social security, 401k, roth ira, or any other investments.\n\nso you could do NOTHING else investment wise and still have a six figure retirement income.\n\ni bought my first house at 24, i was dumb for not buying more and i was dumb for buying a single family home as my first investment, not a 2-4 unit.\n\ni recommend 4 units because that is the biggest you can go with a 30 year fixed rate loan(which is what you want, most ppl use these to buy their homes)\n\na 6 unit property will require a commercial loan and you want to avoid that. way different requirements and rates.\n\ni still max my 401k/roth ira/HSA, but combine that with some rental real estate and you have to really REALLY fail at everything to not retire a millionaire or at least with a six figure income in retirement."
